I have a friend who I’ve known since I was very little. 
One day, when he was six, 
I was at his house when he got this absolutely god-awful stomach pain. 
I mean, he was literally writhing in pain. 
So, 
his mom took him to the doctor’s office, 
where the doctor took one look and told her to take him to the ER. 
She feared something along the lines of an intestinal rupture. 
About half way to the hospital, 
my friend suddenly let rip the loudest, 
most powerful fart any of us had ever heard. 
I swear to God he levitated. 
We thought the upholstery in the car seat had ripped. 
After a good 30 seconds of intense farting, 
he looked at his mom and said, 
“I feel all better now!”

When I was a kid, 
I was always excited to learn new vocabulary. 
When I was in first grade, 
my teacher taught me that “shin” was another word for leg. 
Later that day, I was walking with my mom, 
when I tripped and hit my leg on the ground really hard. 
I yelled out “OW, MY SHIN” 
although my mom heard “OW, MY SHIT.” 
She started yelling about how that was a bad word and we didn’t say that word, 
and she was going to wash my mouth out with soap. 
I was a crying, bawling mess of a child, 
to the point I was doing that weird cry, stutter, hiccup noise. 
She paused in berating me and said 
“Who taught you that word?!” 
Of course, I told the truth 
and said “M-m-my teacher t-t-t-taught me that word!” 
and she started ranting about how she was going to call the school and get that teacher yelled at. 
I tried to explain, 
“T-te-teacher said that shin meant leg I’m SO SORRY ILL N-N-NE-ne-never say it again.” 
My mom got quiet and realized her mistake. 
“…What did you say?” 
Of course I started crying harder and I said 
'NO it’s just a test you’re going to wash my mouth out with soap again.' 
When I finally calmed down enough to say it again, 
my mom apologized and to this day I always say 
“shin”
loudly just to see her face blush."

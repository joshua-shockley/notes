The file structure for this may start out very unorganized but will shortly gain some kind of tread as i find things to place into this RECORD of said experience

EACH CORRESPONDING SECTION IS OBVIOUSLY IN THE FILE WITH THE PROPER LANGUAGE NAME... 

JAVASCRIPT:
    this will have some of a little of everything I have don through Lambda... importing small exercises and then some of the little prjects and things that help understand how to use the concepts... 
    most of these have been moved to my external hard drive so I'll need to grab them from github or just do little remakes as practice


PYTHON:
    this is all i could bring over for now.. will bring more later on
    
    I will be going back through this to get more practice also


    To Start/Run the files...
        need to setup the shell and make sure python3 is installed check for  python3 -v in the terminal after cd down to the directory holding the file you want to run... if it shows updated version then do "pipenv shell" into term and then you can just type "python3 (file name).py" and it runs the script.


C++:
    this is a new one for me so this may take a minute to get to run properly... errors from start. :(

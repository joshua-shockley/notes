The file structure for this may start out very unorganized but will shortly gain some kind of tread as i find things to place into this RECORD of said experience

EACH CORRESPONDING SECTION IS OBVIOUSLY IN THE FILE WITH THE PROPER LANGUAGE NAME... 

JAVASCRIPT:
    this will have some of a little of everything I have don through Lambda... importing small exercises and then some of the little prjects and things that help understand how to use the concepts... 

    most of these have been moved to my external hard drive so I'll need to grab them from github or just do little remakes as practice


PYTHON:
    this is everything I think I have from this section.... I will be going back through this to get more practice also


C++:
    this is a new one for me so this may take a minute to get to run properly... errors from start. :(
